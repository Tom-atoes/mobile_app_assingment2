// DOCUMENTATION: doesnt exist apparantly, awesome!!! i lovvvvveeeeeeeee appshed its so AWESOME! :glee: :slight_smile: :heart_eyes:

/* 
i hate app shed - doesnt even support github :slight_frown:

this is my apps JS code, this code is located under the "Settings" tab and then under the "Advanaced" tab in the Appshed Editor.

i have made a github repo because appshed is awful to navigate and i dont want to drive myself mad.

app.setTabBarBackgroundColor("#474747"); // no clue if this supports rgb so hex it is
